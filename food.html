    <title>MY FAVOURITE FOOD</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>About The Food</h1>
    <p>The name of my Favouritefood is jellof rice with chicken.
        This is a delicacy that is well known in Africa. Jollof rice is one of the most common West African dishes eaten
        in the regions of Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, Senegal, Gambia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Cameroun, and Liberia.
        However, each of these West African countries has their own variation of this meal.
        It is inexpensive and easy to make yet, delicious.

    <h1>How To Prepare Jellof Rice With Chicken</h1>
    <p>When cooking Jellof rice, building a flavor base is very important. Don’t be in haste to dump your ingredients in
        the pot otherwise, you will end up with what we call ”concoction”. Each step counts so try to do each of the
        steps in detail.

        The inevitable foundation for building up the flavor in this meal is to start by sauteeing the Onions. This
        should take about 3 to 5 minutes. The next thing is to stir in the Tomato paste. This adds a deep and rich
        tomato flavor; I simply fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabouts.</p>
    <p>Add the Ginger and Garlic and cook along with the Tomato paste for another two minutes; Actually, by the time
        this ready, you will notice it in the smell. If you keep it cooking any longer you might risk burning them.
        Add my blended peppers. Usually, there is no particular time frame for frying this pepper. I often stop when the
        sauce becomes really thick and the oil literally floats on top of the sauce. At this point, most of the water is
        gone and the sauce no longer smells raw. Trust me you will know but just in case, you are still in doubt, I
        would say maybe 20 to 25 minutes depending on the quantity of water in your blended pepper.</p>

    <p> Finally, in building my flavor, I add the Thyme, Curry powder, Salt, white pepper (good but optional) and
        seasoning cubes. Adjust the seasoning at this point if there is a need to. Once the flavor is on point, then, I
        stir in my Rice. Make sure you stir the Rice properly until you cover each grain of Rice with the sauce. Now add
        the chicken stock. Give it a brief stir and cover it up with a tight-fitting lid. If your lid is not fitting
        enough, simply cover the rice with a foil paper before covering it with the lid. This is because Jollof needs a
        lot of steam in order to turn out well.
        Once, the rice comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low immediately and continue to cook until the rice is
        done about 20 to 25 minutes.
        Serve with Fried Chicken, Spicy Grilled Chicken, Grilled Tilapia Fish or Gizzards and plantains. </p>
