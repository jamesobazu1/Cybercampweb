    <h3 class="story">WHAT I THINK ABOUT THE MOVIE</h3>
    <p>The movie is a really interesting one because a girl who didnt fit in anyway since she was a teenager could fight for people she knew and everybody in the world.
        Katie was not really getting along with her dad because her dad couldnt understand her which really made her distance herself from her dad.
        The all katie and her family saving the whole all started from a man who invented a robot that is program to do whatever you want it to do for you.
        After all the agruement during the process of saving the world, the mitchelle family who were called the wrost family ever saved everyone.
